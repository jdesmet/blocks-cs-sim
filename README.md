## Block oriented Control System Simultor

This was the onset, and the only leftover I could find, of a personal project I did during college. It is a very simple concept: to
represent a Control System using their individual blocks, each block a set of simple properties and a formula that tells how a step
in time has to be calculated. The step in time had to be small enough to reach sufficient precission, but required compensations could
be made.

I need to catch up on the subject for control systems, but it worked real well. It had a formula parser which could parse out an
expression and provide an evaluation to a numeric value (beginning of my JMEP project), and there should be somewhere some optimizer
logic hidden I hope, that allows a Control System to approach a certain goal.

That be said - it must have some pieces in there useful to learn - and maybe this is an ideal project to convert over to Java. Code is
surprisingly less.
